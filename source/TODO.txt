 Reduce products of kernels - only at the end for output (otherwise some expansion rules get tricky)
 Rename Kernel -> BaseKernel, KernelGrammarExpression -> CompoundKernel
 Compound Kernel should know how many dimensions it operates in
 Think about heteroskedasticity
 Write Laplace-ish evidence approx in MATLAB
 Write GPML-caller
 write gpml-parameter parser
 write some sort of search controller
 Think about number of iterations for optimization
 Think about multiple restarts / initialization
 Allow number of operators to be expanded (enumeration?)
