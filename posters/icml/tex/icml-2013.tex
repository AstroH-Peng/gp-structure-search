\mysection{Gaussian process regression can model many structures with an appropriately chosen kernel}

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The kernel encodes the inductive bias of the model \ie the types of functions the model `believes in'
  \item Below we list standard base kernels, and examples of functions the model believes in (samples from the prior)
\end{itemize}

\mysection{We consider all kernel expressions\\derived from a generative grammar\ldots}

\vspace{0.25\baselineskip}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Constructing appropriate composite kernels has previously been the domain of Gaussian process experts
  \item We consider all algebraic expressions involving a small number of base kernels and the operations `$+$' and `$\times$', including \eg
  %\item These operations are interpretable\ldots
  %\begin{itemize}
  %  \item Addition of kernels corresponds to the addition of independent functions
  %  \item Multiplication of kernels behaves like an `AND' operation, combining properties of the base kernels
  %\end{itemize}
  %\item \ldots and produce a rich space including many standard statistical models

\mysection{\ldots which we search greedily, producing progressively better statistical models}

\vspace{0.25\baselineskip}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We try all base kernels, selecting the one with the highest (approximate) marginal likelihood which balances data fit and model complexity
  \item The search continues by adding an extra term to the current best kernel, stopping when marginal likelihood no longer improves
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item By automatically inferring an appropriate kernel, we can also automatically decompose functions into additive components (additive components of the kernel correspond to independent additive functions)
